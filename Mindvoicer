We can imagine some pictures in mind although it is not that clear.
But, we can say something in mind without uttering and can hear and interpret that clearly.
That means a device may be able to read and transmit that voice of mind.
I will call it Mindvoicer.
Mindvoicer can role as a voice.
So, I will say something that can be handled by voices.
Currently we have some graphic user interface(GUI) techniques and voice user interface(VUI) techniques.
Combining graphical and voice user interfaces, we can make a GVUI.
But drawing a picture using a GVUI may be difficult.
Capturing the mind for a drawing movement looks difficult because it is not that clear.
But, there are techniques for drawing by eye movements and I will call it a Drawingeye.
By combining the techniques of Mindvoicer, GVUI and Drawingeye, we can ditch the keyboard and mouse of small computer-like gadgets.
